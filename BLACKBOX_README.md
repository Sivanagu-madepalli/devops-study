# Terraform Tutorial

This repository contains a series of Terraform configuration files that demonstrate how to use Terraform to manage infrastructure. The files are organized into directories based on the topic they cover.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install Terraform. You can download the latest version of Terraform from the [Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/install.html).

Once you have Terraform installed, you can initialize a new Terraform project by running the following command:

```
terraform init
```

This command will create a new `.terraform` directory in the current directory. The `.terraform` directory will contain all of the state files and configuration files that Terraform uses to manage your infrastructure.

## Creating a Terraform Configuration File

The main Terraform configuration file is called `main.tf`. This file defines the resources that you want to manage with Terraform.

For example, the following `main.tf` file defines an AWS S3 bucket:

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-bucket"
}
```

## Applying the Terraform Configuration

Once you have created a `main.tf` file, you can apply the Terraform configuration by running the following command:

```
terraform apply
```

This command will create the AWS S3 bucket that was defined in the `main.tf` file.

## Destroying the Terraform Configuration

If you want to destroy the infrastructure that was created by Terraform, you can run the following command:

```
terraform destroy
```

This command will delete the AWS S3 bucket that was created by the `main.tf` file.

## Conclusion

This tutorial has shown you how to use Terraform to manage infrastructure. For more information, please see the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html).
